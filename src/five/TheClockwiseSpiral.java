/**
 * Classic definition: A spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point,
 * getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.
 *
 * Your objective is to complete a function createSpiral(N)
 * that receives an integer N and returns two-dimensional array
 * where numbers from 1 to N should be represented as clockwise spiral.
 *
 * Return an empty array if N < 1
 * Examples:
 *
 * N = 3 Output: [[1,2,3],[8,9,4],[7,6,5]]
 * 1    2    3
 * 8    9    4
 * 7    6    5
